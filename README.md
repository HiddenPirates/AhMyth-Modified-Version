# AhMyth-Modified-Version
AhMyth is an popular open source android rat. But the official AhMyth contains many bugs. For an example, you can't fetch victim's files from the remote server using official AhMyth. So that we have modified the rat and remove all bugs and also added some extra features. 

### It consists of two parts :

- Server side : desktop application based on electron framework (control panel)
- Client side : android application (backdoor)

## Features
- GPS Logging
- Microphone Recording
- View Contacts
- SMS Logs
- Send SMS
- Call Logs
- File Explorer & Downloader
- Built In APK Builder
- Camera Access

## What's new and fixed bugs
- Fetch files bug fixes
- Device administrator permission added that normal users can not uninstall the payload
- Fetching victim's location bug fixes
- The name of the apk file has been changed to Google Play Service so that the victim does not understand that it is a payload.
- Also has been changed the apk icon.
- Android 10 and 11 supported
- App icon will hide if the victim's phone's android version is below android 10. (That's why device admin permission added to prevent uninstallation)
- Now penetration tester can manually hide and unhide app icon (If victim's android version is below Android 10 then the hide/unhide button will show)
- To unhide app icon, dial *55555# and apk icon will be unhidden.
